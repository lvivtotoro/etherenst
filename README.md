# EtherenST
A real-time strategy server

## How does it work?
EtherenST simulates an RTS game from scratch (with no dependencies, yet).  
It currently supports units and simple debugging tools to visually see the world.  
Anyone can use this library for their RTS game, whether it'd be singleplayer or multiplayer. (Do note that multiplayer is not supported yet)

## Planned Features
- A robust event system (Without reflections)
- Multiplayer support (for this there needs to be a specification, one that uses little bandwidth)
- A* pathfinding (You will be praised if you implement this, since entities can collide with eachother)
